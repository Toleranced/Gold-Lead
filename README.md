Копировать код
<section id="lore" class="py-16 px-6 md:px-12 bg-gray-900">
    <div class="container mx-auto">
        <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold text-center mb-12 text-dorkos-accent">Лор: Путь к Темной Славе Петуха</h2>
        <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto space-y-8 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            <p>
                Доркос — это не имя, а клеймо как у собаки, символ неудержимой амбиции и абсолютного безразличия к человеческим судьбам.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
</section>
The Lore card introduces a dark and deep narrative, combining sharp design elements and a sleek background for readability.
